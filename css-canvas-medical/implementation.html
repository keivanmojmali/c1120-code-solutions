              <p>
                You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that <br>
                we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our <br>
                goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one <br>
                way or the other. We will provide access to a sandboc of the Canvas application for <br>
                you to get a feel for the platform as well as reference to current customers to talk <br>
                about thier experiene.

              <h3> <span class="large">2.</span>Interfaces and Community Integration</h3>
              <p>
                Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community <br>
                resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax, number, enrolling your <br>
                payers with our clearhouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We&apos;ll <br>
                also load your preffered specialist and imaging centers into Canvas so that <br>
                sending referrals closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health <br>
                information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we <br>
                will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

              <h3> <span class="large">3.</span>Data Migration</h3>
              <p>
                The first thing we will do is hain access to a full backup of your current data, which <br>
                we have executed succesfully with both remotely hosted and on-oremise EMR <br>
                databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demofraphics and <br>
                information like medication, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. <br>
                While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has <br>
                been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs

              <p>
                We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, <br>
                charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks <br>
                priot to go-live to familiarize relevant team memebers with clinical, practice <br>
                management, and biulling workflows. Either beofer or during goo-llive, one of our <br>
                team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implemenation and <br>
                training.

              <p>
                Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be <br>
                with you, either in-person or remotely depeneding on your preference, to make sure <br>
                everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have <br>
                handful of encounters in Cavnas under your belt; changing clinical microtemplates, <br>
                setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more. <br>
                We are here to help with it all.

              <p>
                All EMR contracts should contain assuranaces against broken promises and provide <br>
                support over the long term. Our Performance Warrant means that if we are not <br>
                metting expectaions, you can terminate the afreements and receive al payments <br>
                back. (We do not expect this to happen). For ouur Standard plans, we also offer <br>
                MIPS gurantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for <br>
                everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a <br>
                long, productive partnership for us both.
