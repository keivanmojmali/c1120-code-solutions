             Our mission is to give clinicians and their team highly usable, intelligent <br>
             tools to advance their practice of medicine - and improve their day to <br>
             day.

            <h1>What We Believe</h1>
            <p>
              Why did we enter this croded field? Because medical records have fallen <br>
              dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality and effiency of health <br>
              care. Clinicians spend far too long at their computers. Wprlf;pws are overly <br>
              restrictive. Valuable medical data is left unstructured.

            </p>
            <p>
              We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their technology <br>
              partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes art and science- technology can <br>
              help pr hinder this craft. Working with clinicians across the country, we think we <br>
              have begun to build something that helps.

              Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna - a family <br>
              nurse practicioner - sacrifice family time in the evenings to "finish" charting. It <br>
              never ended.

              Andrew knew that the answer wasn&apos;t to go out and do it alone. He started to fill the <br>
              gaps in his experience. Seven practicing clinicians formed the lcinical advisory <br>
              board - rather than leave practice to work full0time with Canvas, they used <br>
              and reviewed product changes in their
              practices. Out Medical firector, Dr.Zimmerman, <br>
              joined when he saw the potential of Canvas to help independent practices like his <br>
              praactice, Temescal Creek Medicine in Oakland, CA. Julian joined Canvas after <br>
              working at Medicare and seeing the failures of current technology to keep up with <br>
              increasing regulatory demands without burdening clinicians. Joe and a world class <br>
              group of software developers joibed to accelerate our ability to listen to clinician. <br>
              feedback and contasntly improve the product.

              With Canvas, we created a fundametally different way of charting that comletely <br>
              eliminates the need to menus and pop-ups. The name of the company describes <br>
              the charting experience - it feels like a blank canvas where you can tell the <br>
              patient&apos;s story and seamlessly complete the notes, orders, and chart review on a single, <br>
              unified screen. With seamlessly, integrated population health, billing, and practice <br>
              management, Canvas is a reimagined platform for the moden primary care <br>
              practice.
